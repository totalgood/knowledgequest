      - 
        - user
        - answer types: [free text, multiple choice, T/F]
      - [chatbot, respond with other alternative correct answer(s) sorted by score]
      - [chatbot, compare USE vector of user answer to correct answer(s) to score correctness]
      -
        - user
        - response choices:
          - "I don't think so"
          - "you're wrong"
          - "I disagree"
