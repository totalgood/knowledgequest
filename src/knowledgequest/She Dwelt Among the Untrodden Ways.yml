  title: She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways
  author: William Wordsworth
  text: |
      She dwelt among the untrodden ways
      Beside the springs of Dove,
      A Maid whom there were none to praise
      And very few to love:

      A violet by a mossy stone
      Half hidden from the eye!
      â€”Fair as a star, when only one
      Is shining in the sky.

      She lived unknown, and few could know
      When Lucy ceased to be;
      But she is in her grave, and, oh,
      The difference to me!

  title: She Dwelt among the Silent Few
  author: Hobson Lane
  text: |
      She dwelt among the silent few
      Inside the home of doves,
      An engineer whom none did praise,
      And very few would love:

      A rose beside a drying bed,
      Half hidden from the eye!
      Fair as a sliver of orange moon,
      Rising to the sky.

      She lived unknown, and few could know
      When Arzu caught my eye;
      But she is in my heart, and, oh,
      The difference to me!
