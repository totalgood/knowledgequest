q: How to use chi squared test in feature selection?
a: Personally I find it hard to know ahead of time what the right threshold for chi**2 test is. Instead I use automatic dimension reduction techniques like PCA, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning (grid search). These require less "judgement" on my part. I let the data and algorithm make the decision for me.

q: What's the benefits of using log loss vs accuracy? And usually where log loss is used? (do we just treat for example 5 % quantile as outliers?)
a: There are numerous cost/loss functions you can use, or you can make up your own. Almost all of them will give you the same answer to your optimization/fitting problem. But some will be better or worse at telling you how good your model is at predicting the things you care about. Sometimes you care about the standard error, sometimes you care about the log of the computer standard error, sometimes accuracy is more important to the success of your project, sometimes precision, sometimes recall, sometimes F1 or AUC. What do you think the agile approach would be to answering your question? Is there a way to use my answer to 1 to come up with an approach to question 2? Is there a way to ask your "boss" or customer which one matters most to them? What is the measure of units that most businesses measure success or lose (cost ) with? What are the best "units" for business decisions?

q: How to detect outliers in a data set and how to handle them?
a: Like other pipeline design challenges, I do outlier filtering in an agile way. Can you guess what that is? Spoiler alert... Outliers can be discarded automatically during hyperparameter tuning, or even within the model itself (random forest or xg-boost) 
a: "Correlation is a mathematical statistic. It can be calculated on any numerical value (integer or binary or float, but not a categorical).  What do we do with all categorical features to create numerical values that work in a machine learning pipeline? Hint: correlation is equivalent to linear regression."
a: think deeply about hot an interesting is different from a float. Is 2.0 Twitter likes the same thing mathematically as 2 Twitter likes ?  30.0 vs 30 years old ? What about 5.0 stars vs 5 stars? What about toaster oven low med high vs a numerical toaster knob with 0, 1, 2 or 0.0 1.0 2.0 ? What about word frequency of 0/1 vs TF-IDF of 0.0/1.0 vs Boolean word presence value of False/True ?
a: Each situation is different. You have to think about the "physics" of something to know what what the best numerical representation is. We can go through some examples to help you learn how to think about numerical value types like binary, int, float, boolean, categorical, ordinal, and continuous things in the real world.

Q: How can I get more confidence in how the time series predictions will work on real data in the future? 
A: Implement an expanding window validation and model training pipeline that trains 100s of models using the last day as the validation example.
-
Q: how to check the correlation b/t two variables between an integer and a continuous value? For example how many people likes a comment on twitter vs the age of user?
A: Ordinals (integers) can be treated just like a continuous value throught a machine learning pipeline, including the correlation coefficient calculations.
-
Q: how to check the correlation b/t two variables between an integer and a boolean value? For example whether a user is an engineer or not. 
A: Booleans (True/False) can be treated just like a continuous value if they are convert to integer 0/1 values or floating point 0.0/1.0 values. They'll work throughout a machine learning pipeline, including the correlation coefficient calculations.
-
Q: Is pearson correlation coefficient work for both for booleans, ordinals (integers)?
A: Yes. Booleans and ordinals are cast to floats (continuous values) and should work fine in any correlation coefficient or any other statistics calculation.
-
Q: What is a Markhov Chain model?
A: A model of state transitions (sequences like time series) where the next state depends only on the current state and not any of the previous states. Example: predictive text that only looks at the last token you typed (or the "<start>" token) to predict the next token.
-
Q: What is a Markhov Chain Monte Carlo model?
A: A Markov Chain that estimates the distribution for the next state by sampling historical data or a simulation. Example: predictive text that only looks at the last token you typed (or the "<start>" token) to predict the next token and estimates the distribution of possible next tokens based on historical data for all the texts you (or people like you) have typed in the past.
- 
Q: What is a static model or distribution?
A: A probability distribution or model whose underlying statistics or behavior do not change over time.
-
Q: What is a deterministic model?
A: A model or algorithm that has a closed form solution (can be solved by evaluating a sequence of mathematical expressions) without relying on random sampling or other stochastic (semi-random) algorithms. A stochastic model or algorithm should converge to the same solution to a given problem (for the same dataset) regardless of when or where it is trained.
-
Q: What is a nondeterministic model?
A: A model or algorithm that has no closed form solution and relies on stochastic or random sampling techniques to achieve a solution.$
-
Q: Give examples of deterministic and nondeterministic models.
A: Stochastic: KNN, K-Means, Stochastic Gradient Descent? Neural Networks with random dropout or random initialization of weights, Random Forest, Decision Tree. Deterministic: Linear Regression, PCA, SVD, Logistic Regression, Polynomial Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent?
- 
Q: What are the characteristics you look for in a Data Science or Machine Learning model?
A: Training time/complexity per data sample and feature (dimensionality). Inference time/complexity. Data efficiency. Number of parameters (degrees of freedom). Linearity/nonlinearity of the solution. Nonlinearity/complexity of the generated model. Classifier or regressor. Supervised or unsupervised. Stochastic or deterministic.
